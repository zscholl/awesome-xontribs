Xontribs are a set of tools and conventions for extending the functionality of xonsh beyond what is provided by default. This allows 3rd party developers and users to improve their xonsh experience without having to go through the xonsh development and release cycle. Core Xontribs These modules are part of xonsh itself but need to be loaded explicitly using xontrib load abbrevs - Fish like command abbreviations bashisms - Bash-like interface extensions for xonsh. coreutils - Additional core utilities that are implemented in xonsh. fish_completions - Populate rich completions using fish shell instead of bash free_cwd - This will release the lock on the current directory whenever the prompt is shown. pdb - Simple built-in debugger. prompt_ret_code - Show return-code from last command in prompt whole_word_jumping - Jumping across whole words (non-whitespace) with Ctrl+Left/Right. xog - This adds xog - a simple command to establish and print temporary traceback log file. Python virtual-environment management vox - Python virtual environment manager for xonsh. autovox - A framework for automatic vox. Tab-completions Extends auto-completion capabilities apt_tabcomplete - Adds tabcomplete functionality to apt-get/apt-cache inside of xonsh. argcomplete - Argcomplete support to tab completion of python and xonsh scripts in xonsh. bash_completions_dirs - Autocomplete loading from directories for the xonsh. django - Django management command completions for Xonsh shell docker_tabcomplete - Adds tabcomplete functionality to docker inside of xonsh. jedi - Use Jedi as xonsh's python completer. makefile_complete - Adds tabcomplete functionality to make inside of xonsh. scrapy_tabcomplete - Adds tabcomplete functionality to scrapy inside of xonsh. Directory Navigation autojump - autojump support for xonsh back2dir - Return to the most recently used directory when starting the xonsh shell. For example, if you were in the '/work' directory when you last exited xonsh, then your next xonsh session will start in the '/work' directory, instead of your home directory. broot - supports broot with br alias cd - 'cd' to any path without escaping in xonsh shell ('cd '\u2192'cd! ') hist_navigator - fish like nextd and prevd with default keybindings. up - The fast way to go up directories. z - Tracks your most used directories, based on 'frecency'. zoxide - Zoxide integration for xonsh. Prompts powerline - Powerline for Xonsh shell powerline2 - Powerline for Xonsh shell forked from santagada/xontrib-powerline powerline3 - Powerline theme with native $PROMPT_FIELDS support. powerline_binding - Uses powerline to render the xonsh prompt prompt_bar - An elegance bar style for prompt. prompt_starship - Starship prompt in xonsh shell. prompt_vi_mode - vi-mode status formatter for xonsh prompt Theming & Styling base16_shell - Change base16 shell themes gruvbox - A gruvbox color scheme for xonsh dracula - Dracula theme for xonsh. Language extensions Changes to the xonsh core language. coconut - Use language features from Coconut, a functional-programming-oriented strict superset of Python. Integrations distributed - The distributed parallel computing library hooks for xonsh. jupyter - Jupyter Notebook kernel for Xonsh kitty - Xonsh hooks for the Kitty terminal emulator. mpl - Matplotlib hooks for xonsh, including the new 'mpl' alias that displays the current figure on the screen. pyenv - pyenv integration for xonsh. homebrew - Add Homebrew's shell environment to xonsh shell on macOS/Linux init_ssh_agent - ssh-agent initialization ssh_agent - ssh-agent integration tcg - tcg integration. xo - Adds an 'xo' alias to run the exofrills text editor in the current Python interpreter session. This shaves off a bit of the startup time when running your favorite, minimal text editor. Plugins autoxsh - Adds automatic execution of xonsh script files called .autoxsh when enterting a directory with cd function cmd_done - send notification once long-running command is finished. Adds long_cmd_duration field to $PROMPT_FIELDS. commands - Some useful commands/aliases to use with Xonsh shell default-command - Run a default command when you press return on an empty command line. direnv - Supports direnv. fzf-widgets - Adds some fzf widgets to your xonsh shell. gitinfo - Displays git information on entering a repository folder. Uses onefetch if available. history_encrypt - History backend that encrypt the xonsh shell commands history to prevent leaking sensitive data. histcpy - Useful aliases and shortcuts for extracting links and textfrom command output history and putting them into the clipboard. macro_lib - Library of the useful macros for the xonsh shell. onepath - When you click to a file or folder in graphical OS they will be opened in associated app.The xontrib-onepath brings the same logic for the xonsh shell. Type the filename or pathwithout preceding command and an associated action will be executed. The actions are customizable. output_search - Get identifiers, names, paths, URLs and words from the previous command output and use them for the next command. pipeliner - Let your pipe lines flow thru the Python code in xonsh. pyrtn - IPython like In[]/Out[] to access python return values in the current session. readable-traceback - Make traceback easier to see for xonsh. schedule - Xonsh Task Scheduling sh - Paste and run commands from bash, zsh, fish in xonsh shell. xpg - Run/plot/explain sql query for PostgreSQL. Python virtual-environment management avox - Policy for autovox based on project directories avox_poetry - auto-activate venv as one cd into a poetry project folder. Activate .venv inside the project folder is also supported. Popular Links Xontribs on GitHub Xontrib Template - make your own xontrib in 10 minutes by using supercharged template.
